The archive file contains IPsec remote access configuration files in .scx and .tgb formats.

	    .scx: Contains the advanced settings of Sophos Connect client in addition
	    to the other settings in the configuration. We recommend that
	    you use this format.

	    The advanced settings provide extra protection, such as running
	    AD logon scripts after the tunnel is established and offering
	    multi-factor authentication. They also allow you to split the
	    tunnel and connect the tunnel automatically.

	    These settings are available if your administrator has configured them. 

	    .tgb: Use this for other IPsec remote access clients. If you use this
	    format for Sophos  Connect clients, you won’t get the advanced settings.
